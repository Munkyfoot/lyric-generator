i will surely go
that i wanna so will i real darkness to the family
all those who see its coming down
we green collar life is possible
out of absence came the spark
a long long time we jam the reggae at the dance
between different beliefs colors classes and creeds
to constreirs of the people and thoughts suggestion i world he face of god or no magicians
mind to the hound to fall on
you lost you people everyones got a story
