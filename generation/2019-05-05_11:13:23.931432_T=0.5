so dont you gonna reme
but watch out boys the girl inside your negative sight
lift these land the meaning of your art
and i will sing it loud
with the sun ill right of the seed
we will rise against
you got your flaws i got mine to be startes reality
the wisdom of the turtle
and thats playing music staying lucid
and see that wash away the pain
