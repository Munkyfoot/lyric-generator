sol sometimes about exposing then i
step one let the music free
lift the flour
so must that sung to keep from the dictions in the chains
that we are no way and the sun loves to drop
a simple message in my island
open up your heart and level inding to the flour
you see im aching shaking minds about living to let to made your bubble illusions in a man
simply toch
reprise
