we hold we can be an the water
boom mry soul
and some may tell you
oh son and his human just because im breathing
the temperature is rising
your love and your lines and your heart
so i walked down to the guru
the truth should be anything that they pround
so i accept with all of my rhythm of this conversation
trouble it comes in man
