the way this girl is walking
the truth should be a mystery
the truth should be a mystery
when theyre raised without the notion of a true equality
in the concrete jungle
the truth should be a mystery
i want to float down river down stream
the wisdom of the turtle
i want to float down river down stream
so i kept my head down continued grinding
